        <h2 class="about-heading">Why Nadia Exists </h2>
        <p class="about-lead">
In our early childhood education setting, we witnessed a troubling pattern: children with challenging behaviors were being excluded from care without support, resources, or a deeper understanding of why those behaviors were happening.
There was no system in place to track behaviors, involve families, or develop strategies for intervention. Exclusion became the default, not the last resort.
Nadia was created to change that. It gives educators the tools to truly understand what a child’s behavior is communicating by organizing data so they can see patterns, identify root causes, and implement individualized strategies that work. Our goal is to reduce exclusions and ensure every child receives the support they deserve.

              <p>Recognized in 2025 as one of Utah’s “20 In Their 20s,” Sadie Rodriguez is the Founder and CEO of Nadia and brings over eight years of experience across early childhood systems, including roles as a therapeutic preschool specialist, child abuse investigator, Behavior Specialist, Manager of Disabilities and Mental Health, Early Childhood Education Manager, and Director of an Early Head Start program. She currently serves on the board for DDI Vantage’s Early Head Start and Early Intervention programs and has presented for three consecutive years at the Utah Early Childhood Conference, at the SLARN Conference, nationally at NAEYC, at numerous professional development events for early education providers across the country, and will be presenting at the upcoming National Head Start Conference.</p>

              <p>Sadie developed a simplified, bilingual behavior support framework rooted in inclusive practice and real classroom application. She approaches challenging behavior not as a problem to remove, but as communication to understand, recognizing that exclusion from programs can damage a child’s relationship with education. As a Latina and Spanish speaking early childhood leader, she focuses on expanding access to Spanish language behavior trainings after identifying a critical gap where educators were not receiving support in a language they fully understood. She believes that when educators are not equipped with the tools and knowledge to teach every child, we are not only failing teachers but also failing the children they serve.</p>
